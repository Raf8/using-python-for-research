# Create a function evaluate(board) that uses row_win, col_win, and diag_win functions for both players. If one of them has won, return that player's number. If the board is full but no one has won, return -1. Otherwise, return 0.
# board is already defined from previous exercises. Call evaluate to see if either player has won the game yet.
