# Now that players may place their pieces, how will they know they've won? Make a function row_win(board, player) that takes the player (integer), and determines if any row consists of only their marker. Have it return True of this condition is met, and False otherwise.
# board is already defined from previous exercises. Call row_win to check if Player 1 has a complete row.
