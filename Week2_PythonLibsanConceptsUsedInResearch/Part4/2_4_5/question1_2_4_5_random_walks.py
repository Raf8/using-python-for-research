# Consider the following code:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time

# How is the location for each step in a random walk related to the locations for other steps?

# They are identical to the previous step, plus random noise.

# What does np.concatenate do?
# Takes any number of np.array arguments, and binds them along the axis argument
