# If the response is quantitative-- say, a number that measures weight or height,
# we call these problems regression problems.
# If the response is qualitative-- say, yes or no, or blue or green,
# we call these problems classification problems.

# From a mathematical perspective, it will be nicer to use column vectors
# but we'll be using row vectors, because they're easier to deal with in NumPy.

# Pseudo Code
#  Loop over all points
#    compute the distance between point p and every other point
# Python cannot handle import when name contains hyphens

# Principal component analysis is a way to take a linear snapshot of the data from several different angles, with each snapshot ordered by how well it aligns with variation in the data. Use the PCA function in the scikit-learn (sklearn) library to find and store the two most informative principal components of the data (a matrix with two columns corresponding to the principal components), and store it as pca.

# Unlike the scikit-learn function, our homemade kNN classifier does not take any shortcuts in calculating which neighbors are closest to each observation, so it is likely too slow to carry out on the whole dataset. To circumvent this, use random.sample and range(n_rows) to sample 10 row indices from the dataset. In this case, use seed 123 to select the row indices of your sample. Store this selection of indices as selection.

# Complete my_prediction with a numpy array. This array will contain predicted values of the wine's quality (i.e., like "high_quality" column in data). You need to use the knn_predict() function with k=5 to get these values from a subset of the data array (e.g., where indices match selection). Note that selection is already defined from Exercise 8, and knn_predict is already defined as in the Case 3 videos.
# Using the accuracy function, compare these results to the selected rows from the high_quality variable in data. Store these results as percentage.
