# If the response is quantitative-- say, a number that measures weight or height,
# we call these problems regression problems.
# If the response is qualitative-- say, yes or no, or blue or green,
# we call these problems classification problems.

# From a mathematical perspective, it will be nicer to use column vectors
# but we'll be using row vectors, because they're easier to deal with in NumPy.

# Pseudo Code
#  Loop over all points
#    compute the distance between point p and every other point
